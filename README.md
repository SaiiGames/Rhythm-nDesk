# RhythmDesk

RhythmDesk is an experimental game for my game-prototyping course.

## How to play?
1. Connect your android phone and download unity remote 5. 
2. Open up project and hit play button. 
3. Click the green button at the left upper corner.
4. Hit the desk at the right moment.

## I can't play!
The game rely on Unity Remote to pick phone's linear acceleration sensor.If your phone doesn't show gameplay image, you should google this problem. 

## The beat can't accurately correspond to the game note!
That's correct. I don't have necessary knowledge to solve this problem.
